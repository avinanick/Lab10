Postgresql database for SCRUM project

Our database should use one main table that holds the main list of all students,
with backup tables for listing the students that use a particular skill

example of the main table includes the following fields:
	Student_ID integer UNIQUE,
	First_Name char(20),
	Last_Name char(20),
	Standing char(20),
	Department char(40),
	Phone char(40),
	Email char(40)

example of a skill table, named after the skill, includes the following fields:
	Student_ID integer UNIQUE,
	Rate(1-5)

Students can then be found using the INNER JOIN command to list contact information for students with a specific skill and/or rating

Examples of skill tables:
	Soccer
	Football
	(other sports)
	Programming
	Driving
	Writing
	Finance
